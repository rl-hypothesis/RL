The class in test_dqn.py is used to make the link between the policies and the UI:

The instantiation of the class should be done before the systems runs with 5 parameters:
- policies: List of the name of all possible policies.
- dataset: The name of the dataset used. Default='MovieLens'
- num_attr: Number of attributes in the dataset. Default=6 (Number of attributes in MovieLens)
- num_groups_per_step: Maximum number of regions returned each iteration. Default=4
- num_agg: Number of aggregation functions. Default=3 (Mean - Variance - Distribution).

The loop after the class instantiation in test_dqn.py simulate a fully guided scenario. Each time, the method "get_results" is called having 6 parameters and 1 output:
Parameters:
- policy_name: String that contains the name of the policy we want to use.
- prev_selected: The data region selected in the previous iteration. Default=None. It is used to infer Exploration data regions. In the first iteration
